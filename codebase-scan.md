# Whop Integration — Codebase Analysis

Run this prompt in Cursor, Claude Code, or any AI coding tool. It will analyze your codebase and produce a structured report that Whop's team uses to generate a tailored integration guide for your platform.

**How to use:** Copy everything below the line into your AI tool and run it against your project's root directory. Send the output back to your Whop contact.

## Prompt

Analyze this codebase to help Whop's team build a tailored integration plan. Examine the following areas and produce a structured report. Be thorough — check every relevant file, not just the obvious ones.

### 1. Tech stack detection

Find and read dependency/config files to determine the tech stack:

- **Package managers:** Look for `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`
- **Frontend framework:** React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, Angular, or server-rendered templates (ERB, Jinja, Blade, etc.)
- **Backend framework:** Express, Fastify, Rails, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Laravel, Spring, Go stdlib/Gin/Echo, etc.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, DynamoDB — check ORM configs (Prisma, Sequelize, ActiveRecord, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- **Hosting/deployment:** Look for `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `fly.toml`, `render.yaml`, AWS/GCP/Azure config files, `Procfile`
- **Language versions:** Check `.node-version`, `.ruby-version`, `.python-version`, `.tool-versions`, `runtime.txt`

### 2. Current payment integration

Search for existing payment provider code. Look for:

- **Stripe:** imports of `stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`. Find API calls like `checkout.sessions.create`, `paymentIntents.create`, `subscriptions.create`, `customers.create`. Check for Stripe webhook handlers.
- **Tipalti:** imports of `tipalti`, any Tipalti API calls for payee management, payment batches, or iframe embeds.
- **Braintree:** imports of `braintree`, drop-in UI usage, transaction calls.
- **PayPal:** imports of `@paypal/checkout-server-sdk`, `@paypal/react-paypal-js`, REST API calls.
- **Adyen:** imports of `@adyen/api-library`, drop-in component usage.
- **Square:** imports of `square`, API client usage.
- **Other:** Search broadly for terms like `payment`, `checkout`, `billing`, `invoice`, `subscription`, `charge` in route/controller files.

For each provider found, report:
- Which SDK/package and version
- Number of files that import or reference it
- Key API calls being made (list them)
- Whether it's used for one-time payments, subscriptions, or both

### 3. Current payout/disbursement integration

Search for payout-related code:

- **Tipalti:** payee creation, payment batch submission, iframe embeds for payee onboarding
- **PayPal Payouts:** mass payment API calls
- **Stripe Connect:** `transfers.create`, `payouts.create`, connected account management
- **Hyperwallet:** API client usage
- **Custom/manual:** Look for bank transfer logic, CSV export for payments, manual disbursement workflows

Report what you find: provider, SDK, files involved, and what payout flows exist (individual, batch, scheduled, etc.)

### 4. Data models

Find and document the data models/schemas related to payments and users. Look in:

- **ORM schemas:** Prisma (`schema.prisma`), ActiveRecord migrations (`db/migrate/`), Sequelize models, SQLAlchemy models, Django models, TypeORM entities
- **Database migrations:** Find the latest schema for relevant tables
- **Type definitions:** TypeScript interfaces, Go structs, Python dataclasses

Focus on these entities (include all fields for each):
- **User/Account** — especially fields like `stripe_customer_id`, `tipalti_payee_id`, `external_id`, `email`
- **Payment/Transaction/Order** — amounts, statuses, provider references
- **Subscription/Plan** — billing intervals, plan types, pricing
- **Payout/Disbursement/Withdrawal** — amounts, statuses, recipient references
- **Product/Item** — what's being sold
- **Affiliate/Referral** — commission tracking, referral codes

### 5. API and routing structure

Map the API surface:

- **REST endpoints:** Find route definitions (Express `router.get/post`, Rails `routes.rb`, Django `urls.py`, FastAPI decorators, etc.). List all payment/billing/payout related routes.
- **GraphQL:** Find schema definitions and resolvers related to payments, subscriptions, payouts.
- **API versioning:** Check if there's `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/` patterns.

### 6. Authentication patterns

Identify how users authenticate:

- **Auth library:** NextAuth/Auth.js, Passport.js, Devise, Django auth, Firebase Auth, Clerk, Auth0, Supabase Auth, custom JWT
- **Session type:** JWT tokens, server-side sessions, cookies
- **OAuth providers:** Google, GitHub, Apple, email/password, SSO
- **User identification:** What uniquely identifies a user? (email, UUID, external ID)

### 7. Webhook handlers

Find existing webhook endpoint handlers:

- List all webhook routes (e.g., `/api/webhooks/stripe`, `/webhooks/tipalti`)
- What events do they handle?
- How do they verify webhook signatures?
- What side effects do they trigger? (update database, send emails, trigger workflows)

### 8. Frontend component patterns

Understand how the frontend is structured:

- **Component library:** Material UI, Tailwind, Chakra, Ant Design, custom design system
- **State management:** Redux, Zustand, Jotai, React Query, SWR, Vuex, Pinia
- **Where payment UI lives:** Find checkout pages, billing pages, subscription management, payout/wallet pages
- **iframe usage:** Are there any existing iframe embeds? (This is relevant for Whop's embedded components)

### 9. Third-party tools and integrations

Search for other services and tools integrated into the codebase that the platform may want to connect to Whop:

- **CRMs:** HubSpot, Salesforce, Go High Level, Pipedrive, Attio — look for SDK imports, API calls, webhook handlers
- **Accounting:** QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks — look for accounting/invoicing integrations
- **Automation:** Zapier, Make (Integromat), n8n — look for webhook triggers, Zap configurations, automation endpoints
- **Email/marketing:** SendGrid, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Customer.io — look for transactional email or marketing integrations
- **Analytics:** Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics — look for event tracking related to payments
- **Other SaaS:** Any other notable integrations (Slack, Discord, Intercom, etc.)

For each found, report: which service, SDK/package, and how it connects to payment/payout flows (if at all).

**Note:** Many tools (HubSpot, QuickBooks, Salesforce) may be used by the business but not integrated into the codebase. This scan catches what's in the code — the Whop team will ask about other tools separately on the call.

### 10. Migration surface area

Count the scope of work to understand migration complexity:

- Total files referencing the current payment provider
- Total API calls to the current payment provider
- Number of webhook event types handled
- Number of database models with payment provider references (e.g., `stripe_customer_id`)
- Are payment flows isolated in a module/directory, or scattered throughout the codebase?
